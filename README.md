## What You'll Learn
- How to create a simple card flip animation with CSS.
- How to use CSS properties like transform, perspective, and backface-visibility to achieve this effect.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your HTML Structure
First, we'll create the basic HTML structure. This will include a container for the card and two sides 
(front and back) for each card. Here's the code to get started
```html 
           <main>
            <div class="card-container flex gap-20">
                <figure class="me">
                    <img src="./assets/img/waving.png">
                </figure>
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="front grid">
                        <h2>Hover to reveal secret</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="back grid">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="./assets/img/hi.png">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Hey there! I'm Ashedzi a software developer, nice to meet you.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </main>
```
**Explanation:**
- We have a card-container to hold the cards.
- Each card has a front and back side.
- We use flex and grid to center the content and add spacing between cards.

## Step 2: Applying CSS for the Card Flip Effect
### Key CSS Features for the Flip Effect
- Perspective
```css
    .card-container {
    height: 100dvh;
    perspective: 1000px;
}
```
**Explanation:** 
perspective gives a 3D effect. It controls how far the viewer is from the card, making the flip look more realistic.

### Positioning and Transforming the Card
```css
.card, .card2 {
    position: relative;
    width: 200px;
    height: 300px;
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
    transition: transform 0.6s;
    border-radius: 5px;

    &:hover {
        transform: rotateY(180deg);
    }
}

```
**Explanation:** 
- transform-style: preserve-3d keeps the 3D effect intact, and transform: rotateY(180deg) rotates the card 
when hovered to create the flip.

### Positioning Front and Back

```css 
    .front, .back {
        position: absolute;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border-radius: 5px;
        backface-visibility: hidden;
    }
```
**Explanation:** 
- position: absolute stacks the front and back on top of each other.
- backface-visibility: hidden ensures the back side is hidden when flipped.


### Flipping the Back
```css
    .back {
        color: #fff;
        transform: rotateY(180deg);
        text-align: center;
    }
```
**Explanation:** 
- Initially, the back side is rotated by 180 degrees to keep it hidden. When hovered, 
both sides flip, showing the back.
